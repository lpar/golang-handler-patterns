# Three Go http.HandlerFunc design patterns

Someone asked how to go about passing a database to `http.HandlerFunc`
functions on the Golang Slack, and I couldn't find a good writeup of the basic
techniques.

So, this repository contains examples of three design patterns for passing
databases (or other essential runtime application state) to your HTTP handlers.

The article explaining the three techniques is at http://lpar.ATH0.com/2020/08/golang-db-patterns/
